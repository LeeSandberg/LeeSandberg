Hi, I’m Lee Sandberg

I’m a multidisciplinary developer and creator with experience across games, electronics, AI, robotics, and cloud solutions. My background spans from building interactive experiences in Unity and Unreal Engine to developing IoT and embedded systems, and most recently, scaling projects into the cloud with CI/CD pipelines.

🔭 Current Focus

Exploring Unreal Engine 5 and advanced cloud CI/CD workflows

Experimenting with AI (TensorFlow, Keras, DNNs), edge computing, and robotics

Designing electronics, embedded systems, and IoT devices

Building creative large-scale projects (e.g., converting a barn into a full-scale theater space)

🌱 Areas of Interest

Game development – Unity, Unreal, and interactive design

AI & ML – deep learning, biological programming, and quantum computing

Hardware & Robotics – custom electronics, IoT, mobile robots

Cloud solutions – GPU/TPU-enabled pipelines, scalable infrastructure

🤝 Collaboration

I’m always open to collaborating on innovative and meaningful projects—whether that’s in games, research, AI/ML, robotics, or creative tech. I thrive where technology meets creativity.

If you’re passionate about pushing boundaries and working with modern compute (GPU, TPU, QPU), we’ll likely be a great fit.
